Tired of FAKE FOOD REVIEWS ? We feel you.. What if we told you that all our reviews are from an honest source? That’s right, these are carefully handpicked and trustable food bloggers, chefs, and food Instagrammers, also known as Zirafers. The Zirafers that we have chosen recommends places truly out of their love for good food, not because some restaurant paid them to write an ‘honest’ review!

On top of that, not everyone is allowed to give a review on Ziraf, only selected Zirafers are given the green light. Why so? This is because we believe that not everyone is a food critic, and there is a certain group of people with the credibility and the passion to do so. For example, when our pipe burst, we call the plumber. When we’re sick, we see a doctor. Why not leave it to the Zirafers to fish out London’s well kept food secrets ?

Ziraf expands the horizon, from having yummy street food delicacies by the canal, to having a candlelight dinner with your loved one in a petite restaurant tucked away in an alley and to even having a dedicated For The Gram category for restaurants that are just oh too pretty!

We can go on and on, but we feel it is best that we leave the exploration to you.
